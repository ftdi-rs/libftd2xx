## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Updated `libftd2xx-ffi` dependency from 0.5.1 to 0.6.0.  This updates the vendor library from 1.4.8 to 1.4.22 for Linux targets.

## [0.24.1] - 2021-01-30
### Changed
- Streamlined `udev` rules recommendations.
- Improved documentation annotations for platform-specific features.

### Fixed
- Fixed compilation errors for `aarch64-unknown-linux` targets.

## [0.24.0] - 2020-12-28
### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE** `read` and `write` methods now return
  `Result<usize, FtStatus>` where `usize` is the the number of bytes read or
  written.
  Previous `read` and `write` functionality that returned
  `Result<(), TimeoutError>` is replaced by `read_all` and `write_all`.

## [0.23.0] - 2020-10-23
### Changed
- `synchronize_mpsse` will now timeout if no read data is received and a read
  timeout has been set.

## [0.22.0] - 2020-10-15
### Added

- The return vector from `list_devices` is now sorted.

## [0.21.1] - 2020-10-08
### Fixed
- Expose `ClockBits`, `ClockBitsIn`, `ClockBitsOut` enums.

## [0.21.0] - 2020-10-07
### Added
- Added methods to `MpsseCmdBuilder` for clocking data bits in and out.

### Fixed
- Modified `clock_data_in` in `MpsseCmdBuilder` to accept `usize` instead of
  `u16` to allow for the maximum command size (65536) to be used.

## [0.20.0] - 2020-10-05
### Changed
